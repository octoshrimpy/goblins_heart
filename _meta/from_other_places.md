### ideas

* octopus in underground lake tha gifts you knowledge in return for non-cave treats that the octopus used to have as a wee child before it became too big to go splorin the surface
  * knowledge is shown as a real object. if you don't pick it up fast enough a raccoon will roll past ans swope it with reachy grabby hands
  * what if the octopus is self-conscious and when you first meet it has a lil "human" it made out of cave things on the top of a tentacle to lure you over to speak to it because it is shy. it then falls off the tentacle after you deliver the first or second fetch quest and then its like "oh.... uhm... uhhhh... ....hi.."
  * the raccoon swipes the fallen "human" and wears the clothes for fun
  * raccoon runs a shop for stolen goods
  * after raccoon swipes knowledge (will happen once on purpose) it can stand up on hind legs and becomes an NPC in the cave
  * you get to watch friendship between octopus and raccoon develop over time
  * octopus used to be in a tank in the city
  * the octopus pool is there but not octopus yet
  * someone left the window open, the raccoon goes in to steal something, the octopus grabs on and they end up in the cave
  * raccoon has 2 cousins, one of which owns a trenchcoat and they go bowling on thursdays
