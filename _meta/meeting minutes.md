# charms

* mods/charms/keychains that are standalone
* deconstruct found tools into crafting components?
* merge charms?

1. mine hollow crystal
2. magic-smelt found tools into essence
3. pour essence into hollow crystals
4. upgrade charm with crystals

scavenging low stat items to merge - very gobbo

need workstation
