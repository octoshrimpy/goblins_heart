* you're a goblin living underground

* you like to collect sticks and flowers and shiny rocks

* you can only come out at night time

* the sun burns your skin

* gather resources underground

* gather resources on the surface at night

* you are a nice goblin, only want peace and plants

* manage a shop for travelling merchants (humans too)

* use money to purchase rare/exotic materials

* use materials for crafting items to sell, or for building up the town

* grow a town of goblins underground as wanderers join you

* dig into procedural-gen caves to build

* grappling hook

* slime boots + slingshot

* umbrella for slow falling

* when entering a room, still side scroller like hollow knight

* make friends with daytime creatures somehow

* critter friends bring you resources (auto-gathering)

* explore the surface, or the treetops

* procedural-gen monsters based on `body part size = perk amount`

* once town big enough, monsters attack from unexplored caves like MC or Kingdom

* you can setup walls, hire guards, and/or build turrets
