## ideas

* cat tells player to start selling
  * will send friends to look at shinies
  * cats can go on fetch quests to overworld during the sun
    * trade for underground fishies/snacks

## games to look into for inspiration
* hollow knight
* ori & blind forest
* celeste
* moonlighter
* dig dug
* core keeper
* spelunky
* starbound
* supermeatboy
* jump king
* samuraigunn

hollow knight
  floaty, but heavy
  wallgrab - slows down descent `mantis claw`
  double jump `monarch wings`
  dash - `mothwing cloak`
  massive dash - charge-up, static launch, only horizontally `crystal heart`
  pogo - default attack

metroid I & II
celeste

ori & blind forest
  floaty fluid mobile

player controller
  sprites
  keyboard || controller

Deep rock galactic
  homey atmosphere (and playerbase)
  drinks affect gameplay (irl-esque)

---


handmade map
  collisions
  tiles
items
  spawning
  mechanics how to find && pickup
  inventory
  storage system
  sprites

``` code (not like this)

  function wake() {
    moveTo(ctx.room.find(chair))
    ctx.interact()
  }

```

``` recipe card (like this)

  onTooTired: // signal
    cleanup
    goto home

  onMomSms:   // signal
    if includes "help"
      goto mom's house

  onGoto loc:
    if loc not home && (kaleb.isHungry || kaleb.isSweaty):
      goto home
      if sweaty: wash up
      if hungry: eat
      goto loc

  // main codebase
  run: 
    wake
    move to chair
    turn on tv
    while put on clothes:
      watch tv
    goto gym
    while not drenched:
      workout
      // gets signal of too tired that can override
    cleanup
    goto home

```
