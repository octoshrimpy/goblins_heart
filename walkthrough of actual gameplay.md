intro to game explaining you've travelled away from all the fight and greediness of goblins back home looking for a peaceful life with trinkets

after you collect and store a bunch in your house, even some outside (proudly displayed), someone knocks on your door and asks if it's for sale, as it's lovely. they mention you have a nice collection and should open up a shop

next day you find a wooden panel and some paint, regardless of where you go exploring. back home, interacting with the piece of wood on the ground lets you "paint sign". after that you need to interact with the sign again to "hang sign outside". this last interaction is what triggers the opening of the shop

every day you can run the shop or go explore. there is no "day limit" (moonlighter) for how long the shop can stay open. you can go indefinitely until running out of items, or stop whenever.

customers may have requests, but they are not timed, and customer won't show up looking for it until all items have been gathered. this means that you have one less customer appearing (doesn't appear if it was meant to and has active quest, does not get replaced), forcing the player to go out and explore and gather

customers may have rumors of cool new places or items, or happenings.
for example, a rumor of a robbery and they're hiding the gold coins somewhere in a cave, and the player will can stumble into the cave if they go exploring within x days

your skin burns in the daylight, and can only go onto the surface at night

you will trade/barter for a nice cloak, and can go outside in bits at a time.
you have a cooldown time, and have to climb into the canopy to "cool down".

eventually you open up skill trees:
  * smithing
  * carving
  * leatherworking
  * sewing
  * cooking
  * tinkering
  * magic
  * luck / observation
  * ???

later in game you can create a sub-space lantern. leave the lantern outside at night to recharge, and bring it with you to the surface during the day. the space around you is "night time" and you're in a space bubble, nobody from the surface can see you. your harvesting is from the night-time drops. it also works by recharging during the day and going out at night.

## ideas

1. lights for exploring
  * have to carry a torch for the first bit of the game
  * after enough money, you can puchase a lantern 
  * lantern has bigger light range, and shinies glow from farther away
  * bug lantern: captured glowy bugs, of various colors for fun lighting

2. farming
  * some plants need sunlight
  * light from torches, lanterns, or glowing bugs in glass bulbs
  * no-light variants can be created

3. waypoints
  * waypoints can be turned on and off
  * turned off from home or in-situ
  * turned on in-situ
  * compass points to nearest waypoint
  * turn on waypoints as you expore
  * then turn them off as you head back

# thoughts

> skill trees
build out skills
find someone else to do it and level up their skills?

> movement
crawl: why?
roll: to avoid damage (iframes)
fall damage?
double jump?
grappling gun?
slime boots?
fast travel?

> map
view waypoints and visited terrain like antiqueAtlas
add custom pins
show rough sketch of:
  * areas seen but not been in
  * areas told about by someone else

> notebook
houses compendium
  * items
  * baddies
  * friends
  * quests
  * map 
  * notes?

>light source
torches? should goblins avoid fire?
use mushrooms, jar fireflies and magic stones instead?

> farming
require seeds
require water
require light
merge attributes by cross-breeding?
no plant can have all 3: 
  * make seeds
  * make water
  * make light

> crossbreeding
extract essence of plant
  * base of seed
  * essence of chance
combine essences into seed bases
ability to make a blank seed?

> waypoints
states: broken, disabled, active 
notebook stores which waypoints you've visited
"write down in notebook" animation when fixing a waypoint
why are they all broken?
how would you disable them from home?
