given the following nonexistent animal names in a semi-realistic fantasy setting, tell me whether the animal would be aggressive to a passerby if they got too close, by the way the name sounds:
Strider
Thunderhooves
Glimmerhorn
Radiantride

given the following nonexistent animal names in a semi-realistic fantasy setting, tell me the animal's nature, characteristics and behaviors, in tabular data:
Strider
Thunderhooves
Glimmerhorn
Radiantride

given the following tabular data of nonexistent animals in a semi-realistic fantasy setting, tell me whether the animal would be aggressive to a passerby if they got too close:

| Name          | Nature      | Characteristics                  | Behaviors                                                         |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strider       | Independent | Sleek, agile                     | Tends to keep to itself and avoids confrontation unless provoked  |
| Thunderhooves | Majestic    | Strong, regal appearance         | May be protective of its territory, but not inherently aggressive |
| Glimmerhorn   | Graceful    | Glowing horns, delicate features | Usually non-threatening, but may defend itself if necessary       |
| Radiantride   | Radiant     | Glowing, effervescent            | May be shy and skittish, but not aggressive                       |


given the following tabular data of nonexistent animals in a semi-realistic fantasy setting, guess if the animal would be nocturnal based on the animal's characteristics, whether you can determine or not:

Given the information provided in the table, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether these animals would be nocturnal or not, so here are my best guesses based on their characteristics and behaviors:

Strider: It's difficult to determine whether the Strider would be nocturnal or not based on the information provided. However, given its sleek and agile nature, it may be more active at night when it can use its agility to its advantage.

Thunderhooves: Based on its strong and regal appearance, the Thunderhooves may be active during the day, when it can be seen and appreciated by others.

Glimmerhorn: Given its glowing horns, the Glimmerhorn may be nocturnal and use its horns to navigate and find food in the dark.

Radiantride: The Radiantride's effervescence and shy and skittish behavior suggest that it may be more active during the day, when it feels safer.

Please note that these are only guesses based on the information provided, and without more information, it's not possible to determine with certainty whether these animals would be nocturnal or not.
